# mri-3Dradiomics-endometrialcancer

This repository contains the radiomics and machine learning code associated with the study by Lefebvre et al. published in Radiology (Lefebvre et al. Development and Validation of Multiparametric MRI-based Radiomics Models for the Risk Stratification of Endometrial Cancer. Radiology. 2022).  

This work is largerly based on contributions and Python packages developed by others and reported previously, mainly:
* `pyradiomics` (van Griethuysen et al. Computational Radiomics System to Decode the Radiographic Phenotype. Cancer Research, 77(21), e104â€“e107. 2017)
* `scikit-learn` (Pedregosa et al. Scikit-learn: Machine Learning in Python. JMLR 12, pp. 2825-2830. 2011)
